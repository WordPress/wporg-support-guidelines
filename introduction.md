# Forum Guidelines

[last updated alert here]

Welcome to the WordPress.org support forums. These forums are available to help you solve problems with WordPress as well as any themes or plugins hosted on the WordPress Directories. We offer these forums for free for all users of WordPress, in the hopes that they can join us in improving the quality of WordPress as a project as well as software.

If you’re new to posting, please read the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/support/forum-user-guide/faq/) first.

## User Expectations

Above all, users are expected to be kind, helpful, and respectful. Assume the best of people and try to make things better. Beyond just seeking solutions, users are encouraged to help others. If they know the answer to someone else’s question, it is greatly appreciated that they offer assistance. This is by no means mandatory, and no one is compelled to help anyone else.

All users are required to follow moderator instructions. The guidelines below are not all encompassing as that is impossible. Moderators will regularly make requests for users to change behavior that is borderline violations, in order to steer them right.

Guideline violations will result in posting access being restricted by first being flagged for moderation. This will require a moderator to approve a user’s posts. This restriction is meant to be temporary, and will be lifted when the moderators feel the situation has been resolved. If a user cannot follow the guidelines after that, their account will be blocked from posting. Further actions (such as restricting access to WordPress.org as a whole) can and will be applied if necessary.

## Contacting the Moderators

If a post needs moderator attention, there is a ‘Report this topic’ link on every thread. That will add the post to a queue moderators watch and follow up with many times a day. It can often help if you also add a reply explaining what you need.

If immediate action is needed, or the situation is not in a specific post, users should come to [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat) and post in the `#forums` channel. (please consult the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/support/forum-user-guide/faq/) before contacting the moderators)
