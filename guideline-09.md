## The Bad Stuff...

We need to keep the forums friendly, so, occasionally, topic content will be moderated. In severe cases, users may be blocked. This might mean anything from the light editing of some posts to complete removal of topics and deactivation of accounts. It should really go without saying, but the following are likely candidates for moderation or intervention

- Do not post email addresses, ask others to post their email, or solicit contacting people off the forums
- Do not post, offer, or ask for login information, even test IDs and test passwords. And do not offer off-site contact for the collection of those either.
- Do not post simply to request feedback on your site.
- Do not use a review for support.
- Do not post another person’s private information (job, gender, living situation, location, etc).
- Do not ask for any kind of access in order to provide support, not even for plugins or themes.
- Do not harass or abuse people.
- Do not contact people outside of WordPress.org for support or to respond to a post/review. This includes using contact forms on their websites, phone numbers, social media, or any other contact method.
- Do not abuse the ‘Report this topic’ or ‘modlook’ system.
- Do not post spam and affiliate links, offensive posts, posts without content, or flames.
- Do not recommend specific webhosts, nor post links to webhost recommendation sites.
- Do not post in all caps.
- Do not ask for help regarding premium themes/plugins.
- Avoid asking questions that are more about opinion, like “recommending web hosting providers” or other “discussion topics”, that may lead to pointless wars and/or attract spam replies.
- Do not abuse the `@<name>` mentions, they are not a tool to get faster responses.
- Do not disregard/ignore direct communication from forum moderators.
- Do not seek legal advice on the forums.
- Do not threaten lawsuits or any other legal action on the forums.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive. Every post is judged on its own merits.

And that’s all. Enjoy your stay at the forums! Oh.. And, when you’re done, please mark your topic as “Resolved”. Thanks.
