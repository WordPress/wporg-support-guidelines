## When creating links to other resources

Public links in plugin or theme support topics may only be posted if they meet one or more of the following criteria:

- The link is to the plugin or theme authors own website.
- The link is to the plugin or theme authors own support website.
- The link is posted by the plugin or theme author them selves to an external resource related to the topic.
- The link is to resources on the WordPress.org website.
- The link is to a reputable image-sharing service for screenshots.

### Why is this being enforced?

Links may come and go, websites change, URLs change, this all could mean that someone looking for an answer in the future ends up on a topic that only has links to a website no longer running, or to a site now owned by someone else with different content from what is expected.

Most support related websites have guidelines asking users to post their answers in full, instead of linking to different places, and this is why.

By sharing the information on WordPress.org, you ensure that it is kept available for all WordPress users.
