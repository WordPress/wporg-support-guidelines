## Do Not Post About Commercial Products

For support of commercial themes or plugins, go to the official support channel.

In order to be good stewards of the WordPress community, and encourage innovation and progress, we feel it’s important to direct people to those official locations. Doing this will provide the developer with the income they need to make WordPress awesome.

Forum volunteers are also not given access to commercial products, so they would not know why a commercial theme or plugin is not working properly.

Ultimately, the vendors are responsible for supporting their commercial product.

If you are a vendor and observe someone asking questions about your paid plugin or theme, please direct them towards your own support resources.

While support of commercial products is not permitted in the forums, reviews are permitted if any of the following is true.
<ol>
 <li>The plugin or theme author upsells on this site.</li>
 <li>The plugin or theme itself links or has an option to upgrade to a commercial or “pro” version.</li>
</ol>
  
When a developer who is publishing a plugin or theme does that, that becomes part of the user’s experience and is a valid subject for a review on this site.
