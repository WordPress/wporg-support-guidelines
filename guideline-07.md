## Do Not Create Multiple Accounts (Sockpuppets)

Do not create multiple accounts, aka [sockpuppets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_(Internet)). Sockpuppetry is often used for nefarious reasons, and as such we ask that you simply don’t do it. If a sockpuppet account is identified, it will be [banned](https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/forum-welcome/#being-mod-watched-or-banned) immediately.

**If you are plugin or theme developer only**, having separate personal and “business” accounts is acceptable for uploading code to the WordPress repo or for a very limited capacity of support of that plugin or theme. In that limited capacity that may not be consider to be sockpuppetry.
